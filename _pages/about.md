I am a PhD candidate in Biology and an MS candidate in Statistics at Louisiana State University. My research focus is the integration of mathematical biology and statistical methods in the study of plant systems. My dissertation work looks at model scale in systems ranging from the protein subnetwork to population level. I am interested in studying plant cell biology using mathematical modeling and parameter optimization techniques. 

I am also interested in [STEM education](https://rdale1.github.io/teaching/). I am particularly interested in making mathematical biology more accessible to experimentalists and the general public alike.




## Recent Activities ##
### July ###
* I'll be presenting a poster at the Carnegie Postdoctoral Association ECR conference that precedes Plant Biology 2019!
* I'm starting work as a postdoc at [Danforth plant science center](https://www.danforthcenter.org/) in St Louis!
* I defended my dissertation on 7/3, titled "Dynamical modeling in cell biology using ordinary differential equations". I talked about my work modeling split luciferase in vivo, estimating enzymatic parameters with a model (first time a method is developed!), modeling the plant cell cycle and endoreplication, and my TAR research project for [CIRTL](https://www.cirtl.net/)! 

### June ###
* I attended [FYIM year 3](https://kawai.phy.uab.edu/fyim3/), another great collaborative format!

### May ###
* My new paper on a method to determine enzymatic parameters using a math model is [published in Biochemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.biochem.9b00272)! 
* I attended the [Probability Meets Biology collaborative workshop](https://www.bath.ac.uk/events/probability-meets-biology/) at Bath University! It was fun and I learned a lot, a fan of this format!

### March ###
* I will be leading my workshop [Mathematical Plant Biology: A Collaborative Session](https://web.cvent.com/event/5d8b3b79-86e5-4a7c-bdcc-32e46df1c2ed/websitePage:276b522d-4142-4f2b-89c2-5c1d6c15bbc8) at [Plant Biology 2019](https://plantbiology.aspb.org/)
* I will be hosting my special session [Current Challenges in Mathematical Biology](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11LDmbNcjOWM0zFOcnzkR7En56_BeI6fh/view) att the Association for Women in Math [Research Symposium 2019](https://awm-math.org/meetings/awm-research-symposium/) next month 

## 2018 ##

### August ###
* I received a travel fellowship to attend the [European Student Council Symposium](http://escs.iscbsc.org/) in Athens, Greece next month! 
* I will be presenting at [Finding Your Inner Modeler year 2 this month](https://pages.wustl.edu/haswell/finding-your-inner-modeler/fyim-ii)

### July ###
* My article on using [Bayesian statistics to estimate parameters for a system of SDEs was accepted](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200126) 
* I received funding from LSU Biograds to validate my [ODE-generating algorithm](https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/bamm/2018/thursday/26)

### June ###
* My proposed session for the Association for Women in Math research symposium in April was accepted! It will be a collaborative speed-dating session at the intersection of math and biology!
* I will be chairing the Epidemiology session at SMB next Tuesday! 
* I received the Society for Mathematical Biology Education and Outreach Grant to develop my video game: ["Video game for the promotion of plant biology and quantitative skill development in high school students"](https://youtu.be/FfuvwlxjfYs)! 

### May ###
* I will be presenting my research on my [ODE-generating algorithm](https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/bamm/2018/thursday/26) at BAMM! later this month! 

### April ###
* I received the LSU McDaniel Scholarship to attend ASPB 2018! 
* I will be attending [SMB2018](https://www.smb2018.org/) thanks to being awarded the Landhal Travel Grant! 
* Looking forward to attending a Women in Math networking event at [NIMBioS](http://www.nimbios.org/tutorials/TT_SpatialData)! 

### March ###
* [New simulation](https://rdale1.shinyapps.io/wischu_biol2018/ ) illustrating the relationship between available co2, absorption spectra, light energy, and photosynthesis
* My [2018 Sigma Xi Research Showcase](https://rdaleresearch.tumblr.com/) presentation is live! 
* I was featured in the [April newsletter of the LSU Women in Science group](rdale1.github.io/publications/2018AprilNewsletter.pdf)! 
* Blog post: [Introduction to Bayesian Statistics, Part 1](https://iambecomecomputational.wordpress.com/2018/03/30/introduction-to-bayesian-statistics-part-1/)
* New preprint: [Hierarchical modeling of the effect of pre-exposure prophylaxis on HIV in the US](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/22/285940)
* Check out my [interview with Dr. Huo of the University of Florida](https://community.plantae.org/article/4938546103625713555/interview-bayesian-statistics-for-meta-analysis-of-genomic-data) on using Bayesian statistics for meta-analysis of genomic data
* I'm going to [NextProf 2018 at University of Michigan](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/nextprof-science/about-nextprof/)!
