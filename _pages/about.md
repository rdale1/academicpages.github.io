I am a Postdoctoral researcher at [Danforth Plant Science Center](https://www.danforthcenter.org/). I defended my PhD in July, and am currently an MS candidate in Statistics at Louisiana State University. 

My research focus is modeling processes in cell biology using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). My dissertation work looks at the utility of mathematical modeling in biology: 
* enhancing the interpretation of data given the underlying mechanism
* putting many pieces together to understand their function in system dynamics
* teaching math modeling to students to improve their confidence and autonomy
* characterizing best-practices in interdisciplinary collaboration and communication

For my postdoc, I'm interested in using multi-scale dynamical models, probabilistic processes, and diffusive processes to study how plants make decisions on the assignment of energy, as well as the genetics underlying plant above- and below-ground strategies. 

I am also interested in [STEM education](https://rdale1.github.io/teaching/). I am particularly interested in making mathematical biology more accessible to experimentalists and the general public alike.

## Recent Activities ##
### January ###
* My workshop for PB2020, "Discovering the rules of life through computational plant biology â€“ utilizing
    dynamical mathematical models", was accepted! [Learn more here](https://iambecomecomputational.wordpress.com/2020/01/21/workshop-on-computational-plant-biology-at-pb2020-opportunities-for-participants/)
* My paper "Modeling and analysis of the firefly luciferase reaction and a G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway with ordinary differential equations increases self confidence in mathematical cell biology for novice graduate students" was accepted for publication in *Letters in Biomathematics*! That makes 11. 

### December ###
* I graduated from my PhD program! Now you must call me doctor.  
* I've been developing a [searchable fellowship database](https://www.cientificolatino.com/searchable-fellowships) for Cientifico Latino! 

### November ###
* I've been developing a [stochastic simulation](https://rdale1.shinyapps.io/app_sept_12/) of genetic drift and selection using Hardy Weinberg's model! 

### September ###
* My website focusing on developing collaborative relationships between mathematicians and biologists is up in [its initial iteration](https://rdale.shinyapps.io/initmathbio). Feedback is greatly appreciated! You can join the database through the site. It's fully searchable, by keyword(s) or by your profile. 

### August ###
* I'll be leading a [collaborative workshop on Computational Plant Biology](https://networking.grok.lsu.edu/article.aspx?articleid=14555) at PB2019 in San Jose! If you can't attend, but want to be involved, head [here](https://networking.grok.lsu.edu/article.aspx?articleid=14555) to access the non-attendee survey!
