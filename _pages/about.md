I am a PhD candidate in Biology and an MS candidate in Statistics at Louisiana State University. My research focus is the integration of mathematical biology and statistical methods in the study of plant systems. My dissertation work looks at model scale in systems ranging from the protein subnetwork to population level. I am interested in studying plant cell biology using mathematical modeling and parameter optimization techniques. 

I am also interested in [STEM education](https://rdale1.github.io/teaching/). I am particularly interested in making mathematical biology more accessible to experimentalists and the general public alike.
