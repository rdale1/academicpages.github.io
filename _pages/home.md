## 2020 ##

### September ###
Been a few months.... 
* Collaborative incubator website [InitMathBio](https://initmathbio.com) is finally up! I never thought I'd actually complete it.. chalk it up to quarantine free time. More soon!
* I received a grant to develop an educational video game from ASPB! So excited to see this come to life, and hopefuly help others overcome math anxiety through seeing the magic of math!
* Myself and Dr Amogh Jalihal have started an online [community for early-career modelers](https://amoghpj.github.io/modeling-and-beyond/). You can read more about our vision for this community on my blog: https://iambecomecomputational.com/2020/07/01/modeling-and-beyond/
* The workshop continued to be held for the online PlantBiology meeting in late July. We found that an in-person format would be better for what we had planned (a little too many surveys). Check out the [materials and outline here.](https://www.initmathbio.com/pb2020-introduction-to-modeling/)

### January ###
* My workshop for PB2020, "Discovering the rules of life through computational plant biology â€“ utilizing
    dynamical mathematical models", was accepted! [Learn more here](https://iambecomecomputational.wordpress.com/2020/01/21/workshop-on-computational-plant-biology-at-pb2020-opportunities-for-participants/)
* My paper "Modeling and analysis of the firefly luciferase reaction and a G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway with ordinary differential equations increases self confidence in mathematical cell biology for novice graduate students" was accepted for publication in *Letters in Biomathematics*! That makes 11. 

## 2019 ##

### December ###
* I graduated from my PhD program! Now you must call me doctor.  
* I've been developing a [searchable fellowship database](https://www.cientificolatino.com/searchable-fellowships) for Cientifico Latino! 

### November ###
* I've been developing a [stochastic simulation](https://rdale1.shinyapps.io/app_sept_12/) of genetic drift and selection using Hardy Weinberg's model! 

### September ###
* My website focusing on developing collaborative relationships between mathematicians and biologists is up in [its initial iteration](https://rdale.shinyapps.io/initmathbio). Feedback is greatly appreciated! You can join the database through the site. It's fully searchable, by keyword(s) or by your profile. 

### August ###
* I'll be leading a [collaborative workshop on Computational Plant Biology](https://networking.grok.lsu.edu/article.aspx?articleid=14555) at PB2019 in San Jose! If you can't attend, but want to be involved, head [here](https://networking.grok.lsu.edu/article.aspx?articleid=14555) to access the non-attendee survey! 

### July ###
* I'll be presenting a poster at the Carnegie Postdoctoral Association ECR conference that precedes Plant Biology 2019!
* I'm starting work as a postdoc at [Danforth plant science center](https://www.danforthcenter.org/) in St Louis!
* I defended my dissertation on 7/3, titled "Dynamical modeling in cell biology using ordinary differential equations". I talked about my work modeling split luciferase in vivo, estimating enzymatic parameters with a model (first time a method is developed!), modeling the plant cell cycle and endoreplication, and my TAR research project for [CIRTL](https://www.cirtl.net/)! 

### June ###
* I attended [FYIM year 3](https://kawai.phy.uab.edu/fyim3/), another great collaborative format!

### May ###
* My new paper on a method to determine enzymatic parameters using a math model is [published in Biochemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.biochem.9b00272)! 
* I attended the [Probability Meets Biology collaborative workshop](https://www.bath.ac.uk/events/probability-meets-biology/) at Bath University! It was fun and I learned a lot, a fan of this format!

### March ###
* I will be leading my workshop [Mathematical Plant Biology: A Collaborative Session](https://web.cvent.com/event/5d8b3b79-86e5-4a7c-bdcc-32e46df1c2ed/websitePage:276b522d-4142-4f2b-89c2-5c1d6c15bbc8) at [Plant Biology 2019](https://plantbiology.aspb.org/)
* I will be hosting my special session [Current Challenges in Mathematical Biology](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11LDmbNcjOWM0zFOcnzkR7En56_BeI6fh/view) att the Association for Women in Math [Research Symposium 2019](https://awm-math.org/meetings/awm-research-symposium/) next month 

## 2018 ##

### August ###
* I received a travel fellowship to attend the [European Student Council Symposium](http://escs.iscbsc.org/) in Athens, Greece next month! 
* I will be presenting at [Finding Your Inner Modeler year 2 this month](https://pages.wustl.edu/haswell/finding-your-inner-modeler/fyim-ii)

### July ###
* My article on using [Bayesian statistics to estimate parameters for a system of SDEs was accepted](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200126) 
* I received funding from LSU Biograds to validate my [ODE-generating algorithm](https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/bamm/2018/thursday/26)

### June ###
* My proposed session for the Association for Women in Math research symposium in April was accepted! It will be a collaborative speed-dating session at the intersection of math and biology!
* I will be chairing the Epidemiology session at SMB next Tuesday! 
* I received the Society for Mathematical Biology Education and Outreach Grant to develop my video game: ["Video game for the promotion of plant biology and quantitative skill development in high school students"](https://youtu.be/FfuvwlxjfYs)! 

### May ###
* I will be presenting my research on my [ODE-generating algorithm](https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/bamm/2018/thursday/26) at BAMM! later this month!
