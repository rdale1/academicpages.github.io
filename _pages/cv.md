Scientific Outreach & Service to the Community
======
* Journal Reviewer, Heliyon (2018)
* Guest editor, What we’re reading. Collection of recent research on mathematical modeling in plant biology. https://plantae.org/what-were-reading-january-19th/ (2018)
* Plantae Fellow: scientific outreach with a focus on mathematical plant biology https://community.plantae.org/user/ReneeDale (2017-2018)
* Website Development: Volunteered to assist in web development for interdisciplinary collaborative website compmodelmatch.org. Current version: https://rdale1.shinyapps.io/compmodelmatch/ (2017)
* Academic blogging detailing computational procedures to help beginners in computational biology and the general computing public (iambecomecomputational.com) (2017)
* Academic Twitter devoted to scientific breakthroughs, opportunities for graduate students, computational methodologies, and mental health related information (@b10_m0del1ng) (2017)

Education & Mentoring Activities
======
* Volunteer statistical consultant with Statistics Without Borders (2018)
* Developed web application for undergraduate introductory biology students to enhance their understanding of traditionally difficult concepts, such as membrane potential. Current version: https://rdale1.shinyapps.io/wischu_biol2018/ (2017). The app will allow the instructor access to student activities when using the illustrations and answering questions.
* Developed web application on Ecological Inference to include RxC analysis for assisting laywers to determine possible cases of gerrymandering using district data (2017). Currently the code is private and still under development. 
* CIRTL Scholar: The LSU Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL) provides this certificate to graduate students who study STEM education, design and carry out an experiment, and present or publish their findings. I took discipline-based education resource (DBER) courses, independently studied the literature, designed and carried out an experiment while guest instructor with BIOL 7800, and analyzed the data. I am currently writing up the results.
* Curriculum Development: BIOL 7800 Mathematical Modeling in Cellular Biology with Dr. Kato at LSU (2017). I assisted in conceptual course material development (differential equations, cell biology) and was completely responsible for the technical, programming materials for the course. My lecture materials are available at iambecomecomputational.com and my code examples at https://github.com/rdale1/Matlab-Programming-Examples 
* Curriculum Development: Helped develop a new coursework for use at LSU course BIOL 1005 Laboratory for non-science majors (2016). To help the students come up with independent research topics, I suggested the inclusion of a proposal presentation prior to their writeup. 
* Mentor: Association for Women in Math Mentor Network (2017)
* Mentor: MentorNet (2017)
* Judge: Louisiana Science and Engineering Fair (LSEF) for middle and high school students (2014 – present)
* Mentor: Assisted local middle school students with their science fair projects (2014)
